# Personal portfolio

**Projects**: Design and Code

**Format**: Figma document and coded website

**Timeframe**: Throughout the HYF curriculum. With the UX-UI module and the other programming modules, you should be able to have a portfolio ready by the end of the curriculum. Request for review to coaches.


## Brief

Putting up a personal portfolio website is the hardest project you will ever have, every single time. But it is your “business card” and the key to job opportunities.

More than a presentation of who you are, your portfolio should convey the type of work you want to and can do. Make sure to also include what tools you bring to a project or company and how that can make a difference.

Collect your work and experience along the way, make it evolve depending on your experience and area of work.

## Deliverables

- Sitemap of the entry points and pages of your portfolio
- Content writing (the text on the pages)
- Page layouts (homepage, case study template, about, contact form...)
- A style guide (display page of the CSS used)
- Workable responsive website

## Tips for portfolios

Build case studies to show how you think and to present the work you have done. For designers, it typically follows the structure:

- What was the team set up and what were your own role responsibilities?
- What was the business problem?
- What were the user problems and needs?
- How long the process took and what steps did you take? (Show sketches, design process, and methodology)
- What challenges did you encounter and how did you solve them?
- What was the outcome?
- What impact did your solution have? (Think: success metrics, improvements)

Run a spell checker on your texts. You can use [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) or [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to catch English language errors. If you are using Figma, run a [Figma spellchecker](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/754026612866636376/SPELLL---Spell-Checking-for-Figma).
